# Coding Problem Solutions

Repository of my practice of solving coding problems. For now, I mainly solve problems from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/problemset/). I'm a beginner who just got started, so a lot of the solutions are probably brute force and unoptimized. The unsolved folder is for problems that I tried but wasn't able to solve or didn't pass the test cases.

My Codeforces account is [thepointyraindrop](https://codeforces.com/profile/thepointyraindrop).
