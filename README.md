# Codeforces Solutions

Repository of my practice of solving Codeforces solutions. Just getting started. I'm a beginner and do this for practicing, so a lot of the solutions are probably brute force and unoptimized. The unsolved folder is for problems that I tried but wasn't able to solve or didn't pass the test cases.

My Codeforces account is [thepointyraindrop](https://codeforces.com/profile/thepointyraindrop).
