# Problem Solutions on Codeforces

Repository of my practice of solving Codeforces solutions. Just getting started. Most of the solutions are brute force and unoptimized. The unsolved folders are for problems that I tried but wasn't able to solve or didn't pass the test cases.

My Codeforces account is [pointyraindrop](https://codeforces.com/profile/thepointyraindrop).
